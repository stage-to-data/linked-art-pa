# International Workshop — Linked Art Extension for the Performing Arts  
## Workshop Outcome and Roadmap  

**Dates:** October 30 to November 1st  
**Place:** Université Rennes 2

## Executive Summary  

The *International Workshop — Linked Art Extension for the Performing Arts* (Université Rennes 2, 30 October – 1 November 2025) gathered international experts in digital humanities, ontology design, and performing-arts documentation to advance the development of a Linked Art extension dedicated to live performance data.  

Building on the ERC project *From Stage to Data*, the workshop aimed to validate and refine a data model capable of representing the complexity of performance events, their plans and realisations, and their documentation through archival sources such as playbills and programmes.  

Discussions focused on the integration of performing-arts concepts within the **Linked Art** and **CIDOC CRM** frameworks, the identification of modelling gaps, and the definition of a medium-term roadmap. The “ABC” triptych (**Work / Production / Show**) was validated. Key issues were reviewed in depth, including:  

- The relationship between work and production  
- Audience modelling  
- Plan versus realisation  
- Grouping of performances  
- Language specification  
- The use of *attribute assignment* to record interpretative provenance  

As an outcome, the group agreed to propose a new class, **Exx Performance** – a subclass of *E7 Activity* – to describe intentional, human-initiated actions that embody and express a work within a defined temporal and spatial span. This class provides a coherent framework addressing many of the issues raised during the workshop, notably the representation of complex performance series, online or distributed venues, and the link between conceptual works and their realisations.  

The workshop confirmed the feasibility of a **Linked Art – Performing Arts (Linked Art-PA)** extension and defined the next steps. This collaborative effort establishes a foundation for a shared ontology for performing-arts heritage data.

## Context and Objectives  

Following a first study day in 2024 entitled *Representing the Performing Arts: Ontologies and Data Models* and the ongoing work of the ERC project *From Stage to Data*, this new collaborative workshop focused on modelling the performing arts within the **Linked Art ontology** ([https://linked.art/](https://linked.art/)).  

Originally designed for museums, **Linked Art** aims to enhance the interoperability and accessibility of heritage data by relying on a limited subset of *CIDOC CRM* classes and properties, as well as controlled vocabularies (Getty AAT, etc.).  

The *From Stage to Data* project now proposes an **extension of Linked Art for the performing arts**, based on modelling performance events from playbills and programmes (*case study: Festival d’Avignon, 1947–present*).

## Workshop Objectives  

- Validate and refine the proposed extension for integration into **Linked Art version 1.1**  
- Test and document the model on concrete case studies from the performing arts  
- Establish a roadmap for medium-term developments  
- Work toward interoperability with existing models (**SPA**, **AusStage**, **ArtsData**, **Wikidata**, etc.)  
- Prepare a dissemination and adoption strategy for cultural and heritage institutions
